Destroying their Temples and building your own where they once stood will convince the cities to join your cause instead.\n\n4. Do not hesitate to use Sargon in battle once you have obtained a base. Should he be wounded, he will retreat to your Temple and return to the fight after he has recovered."
81509 "Your scouts report:\n\n- After being banished from Kish, Sargon (Blue) has reached a spring where he can quench his thirst after days of wandering. Another wanderer has arrived – is he a friend or an enemy?\n\n- Ur-Zababa is not satisfied with Sargon's exile. Some of the king's infantry and archers (Orange) are roaming the area, probably tasked with assassinating Sargon.\n\n- Ur-Zababa himself (Red) dwells in his capital of Kish, guarded by a strong force of Priests and Chariots.\n\n- To overthrow Ur-Zababa, Sargon must storm Kish (Yellow), which is defended by infantry, archers, and catapults.\n\n- Sippar (Green) and Borsippa (Purple) are cities ruled by priests loyal to Ur-Zababa. Sippar's army consists of Archers and Catapults, while Borsippa primarily uses Short Swordsmen and Axemen."

Its priests will lead its defense and are difficult to defeat.\n\n- Lugal-Zaggisi (Orange) himself has only tasked a few men with patrolling the region's roads and guarding some of the cities, but spies report that he is massing a large army in his capital to deal with Sargon."
81610 "<BLUE>Sargon: The city-states of Mesopotamia lie before us. They are loyal to Lugal-Zaggisi, but they will follow Ishtar's call after seeing her artifact!"

81617 "<BLUE>Sargon’s Soldier: The artifact has come to Larsa! Its residents – common farmers and rich merchants alike – are equally seized by fear and awe! They bow their heads to the goddess and to you, wise Sargon."
81618 "<BLUE>Sargon: Three enemies defeated – only one city-state left. In the name of the goddess of war, we will conquer even the most stubborn! What are you waiting for, my soldiers? Victory is within reach!"
81619 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: Not so fast, Sargon. You might impress some frightened city militias with your cheap artifact, but not me. Prepare to fight real soldiers!"
81620 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: Now let us see if that self-proclaimed chosen one is immune to our swords and arrows! Charge!"
81621 "<BLUE>Sargon: Well, well... we will soon find out which of us bit off more than he could chew, Lugal-Zaggisi."
81622 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: Who do you think you are, Sargon? A holy man? As far as I know, you have only pushed a senile old man from his throne. Do not make the mistake of considering me such a pathetic figure."
81623 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: Oh, and before I forget... I hear that you are spreading rumors among your followers that I am a cruel desecrator of temples. What exactly did you do in Sippar and Borsippa, Sargon? You are a hypocrite, not a chosen one!"
81624 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: I never liked that city anyway. Untrustworthy wretches who always pay their taxes late. You are welcome to deal with them from now on."
81625 "<BLUE>Sargon’s Soldier: There they run, back to Uruk to lick their wounds! The day is ours!"
81626 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: That was just a taste, Sargon. Next time I will not be so merciful, but will crush you like an bothersome insect!"

81709 "Your scouts report:\n\n- After conquering Larsa, Sargon's army (Blue) has assembled to take the fight to Lugal-Zaggisi.\n\n- Lugal-Zaggisi's ancient capital of Uruk (Green) lies in the west, heavily guarded by Camel Riders, Slingers, and swordsmen.\n\n- Lugal-Zaggisi (Orange) hides deep inside Uruk, defended by his bodyguard of Hoplites and Composite Bowmen. He has also set up defensive camps (Red) outside of Uruk for his vanguard of Horse Archers.\n\n- Rumors tell of nearby farming villages (Yellow) that supply Uruk with food. Eliminating these will be crucial.\n\n- Sargon's new allies from the city of Isin (Cyan) have brought an army of Camel Riders, Chariots, and Catapults to support him.\n\n- South of Uruk lies Ur (Purple), another city loyal to Lugal-Zaggisi. Ur will mainly train Elephant Archers and War Elephants, but its ambitious masons could be even more dangerous than its powerful army..."

81721 "<BLUE>Sargon: Burn them down."

81724 "<ORANGE>Lugal-Zaggisi: How many more soldiers do you want to die needlessly, Sargon? Is this bloodshed part of your divine purpose?"

81909 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Sargon (Blue) has assembled a large army for the invasion of Subartu. This time, he has numerous Villagers and enough resources to start building a camp.\n\n- Subartu (Red) lies to the east and is defended by archers, cavalry, and towers.\n\n- The Hurrians (Cyan) formerly only contributed financially to Sargon's campaigns, but have now been conscripted into military service. They will primarily deploy Catapults, Camel Riders, and Chariots.\n\n- Sumerian Rebels (Yellow) have occupied several villages (Grey) that had once sworn loyalty to Sargon.

241101 "The ways of the gods are incomprehensible. Far more predictable is the path walked by a man who considers himself a god. So too it was for Sargon, the greatest conqueror Mesopotamia has ever known."
241102 "Like the legendary shepherd that founded our great city, Sargon seemed to have descended from heaven a grown man, crafted by the gods to rule the world. But while his true origins remain a mystery, his earthly story began here, in Kish, a place so beautiful that even the lustrous words of the poets cannot do it justice."
241103 "Back when I, Ushar, was still a man of youthful strength, Kish was ruled by Ur-Zababa. If the gods had molded Sargon from clouds and ether, Ur-Zababa was made from common clay. Nothing about him was exceptional, save for his fondness for fine food, extravagant clothes, and luxurious wine."
241104 "Ur-Zababa had appointed Sargon as his cupbearer, and the shy, unassuming adolescent served him wine and kept him company in many a lonely hour. Yet, unbeknownst to the king, Sargon was plagued by a strange, recurring dream."
241105 "Ishtar, the goddess of war, appeared to Sargon in his sleep and promised him extraordinary things. One day, she said, he would be king not only of Kish, but of all the land between the Euphrates and the Tigris."
241106 "Not realizing the weight of his words, Sargon told his master of the dream – and the king turned pale. Had the boy who served him every day truly been chosen by the goddess of war?"
241107 "Ur-Zababa could not allow this prophecy to come true. He banished Sargon to the desert – and in doing so, he convinced Sargon that the goddess had spoken truly."
241108 "Yet, banishment was not enough for the frightened king. He soon sent Kish's most vigorous warriors to ambush his former confidant among the dunes. I was one of those men. As a smith, I was the strongest, and when Ur-Zababa ordered me to swap my hammer for a sword, I accepted... but not without hesitation."
241109 "By now, the tale of the banished servant and his dreams had spread far beyond the royal palace. Many who suffered under Ur-Zababa’s rule saw Sargon as a savior."
241110 "When I finally caught up with him at a remote well, he was resting in the shade. I left my sword in its scabbard and faced a man who showed no fear. In his mind, he was no longer a simple servant. He was, indeed, Ishtar’s chosen one."
241151 "As we entered the royal palace in Kish, I swelled with joy and pride. Sargon had triumphed, and it seemed that this man blessed by Ishtar was truly invincible."
241152 "Yet, in my quiet moments, I wondered if it would ever have come to this if Ur-Zababa had not expelled Sargon. Had we fulfilled a prophecy – or had a simple dream become prophecy only after the fearful king sealed his own fate?"
241153 "Dreams and oracles, visions and prophecies... it seems that these mysterious forces can be as dangerous to those who believe in them as they are to those who ignore them..."

241201 "Our soldiers often wondered where Sargon had actually come from. Some believed that he had descended from heaven like the founder of Kish. Others said that he was an orphan who had been found in a basket floating on the Euphrates. I have even heard some townsmen say that he was the son of a priestess who had given birth without having ever lain with a man."
241202 "Sargon only smiled at these rumors. He said that it does not matter where a man comes from, only where he goes – and that he himself follows the path that Ishtar shows him. That path led to war."
241203 "With Kish subdued, Sargon sent his army to conquer the countless city-states of Mesopotamia in Ishtar’s name. The masters of these cities scoffed at Sargon's ambitions, yet secretly they all feared him."
241204 "In order to match Sargon’s army, they joined forces under the leadership of Lugal-Zaggisi, the priest-killer. He was a brutal man feared for his atrocities across the region. He would often desecrate the temples of the cities that he conquered."
241205 "Yet, he was a capable tactician and a gifted commander – a suitable challenge for Ishtar’s champion."
241251 "After several bloody campaigns, the enemy coalition was crushed. The goddess of war may have enjoyed the slaughter, yet I shuddered at the piles of bodies that we left behind in her name."
241252 "Still, our mission was not over. Ishtar had promised Sargon all of the land that lies between the two great rivers, but as long as Lugal-Zaggisi remained at large, Sargon's claim to hegemony would be challenged."
241253 "As the tyrant fled southwards, our soldiers pursued him to his well-fortified capital of Uruk. There, holed up behind its walls, he began scheming once more."

241301 "Once, as Lugal-Zaggisi was burning down a temple, a dying priest uttered with his last ragged breath: ‘The blood of the innocent will be paid for by the blood of the one.’"
241302 "Not one to ignore a second prophecy, Sargon took the priest’s words to heart when reports of them reached his ears. They became a mantra that our soldiers echoed as we marched on Uruk."
241303 "We knew that Ishtar would guide our way and grant us victory once more."
241351 "When we captured Lugal-Zaggisi, we did not kill him right away. Forcing him into a yoke like a common criminal, we paraded him all across Sargon’s new kingdom. We took him as far as Lagash, within whose ruins the dying priest had pronounced his prophecy."
241352 "The evil defiler looked old and frail as he knelt in the temple ruins for his execution. His death ended the age of kings that had guided the fortunes of Mesopotamia for centuries."
241353 "Now, it was up to Sargon to shape his new empire, and it soon became apparent that he had ambitious plans..."
241354 "...plans that chilled my blood."

241401 "Despite not having been groomed for rule, Sargon had a natural talent for kingship. He built his new capital of Akkad to the north of Sumer, sending his new subordinates a powerful message. He would not follow the traditions established by past kings – no, this was truly a new beginning."
241402 "An enormous court soon surrounded Sargon. More than a thousand servants, priests, scholars, and soldiers populated the king’s palace – and they all had to be fed and paid."
241403 "Sargon therefore turned his sights on neighboring kingdoms. Once, dominion of Mesopotamia had been the sum of his ambitions – but Sargon had changed."
241404 "The larger his entourage grew, the more he pushed his old companions away – and the greater the riches he amassed, the greedier the flickering in his eyes seemed to me."
241405 "He hardly spoke of the goddess of war anymore. He no longer visited her temples, nor offered her sacrifices. It seemed that as his power grew, Sargon forgot to whom he owed his throne..."
241406 "...and now, as he rallied his armies to conquer the kingdom of Elam, he tempted her wrath."
241451 "Can a mortal being of flesh and blood become a god?"
241452 "I asked myself this question more and more often as we embarked on a brutal campaign of conquest through lands so distant that I would never have imagined visiting them."
241453 "The Divine Will, which Sargon once received and taught his followers, was now indistinguishable from his own. He made it abundantly clear that his will was to enlarge his empire, whatever the cost."
241454 "I was not the only one who noticed our king's change of character. Discontent brewed among the population. Many of the soldiers, tired and spent from constant campaigns, harbored thoughts of treason."
241455 "Sargon did not seem to notice his people’s growing distrust. Caught up in his own world, where friend and foe alike gave way to him, he was already planning his next conquest – a campaign that would lead us even deeper into darkness."

241501 "Blood, sweat, tears, and the stench of burning bodies accompanied us on our way east, and it was not long before my fears came true."
241502 "Barely had we crossed into the kingdom of Subartu when our people took up arms in a rebellion. After years of grandiose campaigns, they were sick of the exorbitant taxes that Sargon levied to fund his wars."
241503 "When I shared the bad news with Sargon, I hoped that he would see reason and accept that he had taken things too far – but the hateful glare in his eyes suggested the opposite..."
241551 "Can a mortal being of flesh and blood become a god? The answer is no. No matter how much power a man attains, anyone who towers too far above others is doomed to fall in the end."
241552 "Sargon was the king of kings, the most powerful man that had ever walked the earth, his empire the first that mankind had ever seen."
241553 "In the temples, Sargon had replaced the statues of the gods with statues of himself – and now truly believed that he was divine, yet I had seen him bleed."
241554 "I sought him out after the sack of Subartu, only to find him standing atop a mountain of gold and corpses, precious stones passing through his fingers."
241555 "He did not listen when I told him that this madness had to end."
241556 "Once, I left my sword in its scabbard to spare the man who would be my king – but things were different this time. This was no man standing in front of me. No deity. It was an evil demon from the underworld, striding the earth to claim the souls of the innocent."
241557 "I then remembered the prophetic words: ‘The blood of the innocent will be paid for by the blood of the one.’ I plunged my blade deep into Sargon’s chest. As he stared at me with wide eyes, a strange, wicked smile appeared on his face. Even in the face of death, Sargon never ceased believing in his own immortality."
241558 "I have no such delusions. As old age withers my once-supple frame, I welcome the journey to the afterlife, satisfied that no more innocent blood will be spilled in the name of this false god. Yet, I fear Sargon’s legacy. The vices of power and a desire for divinity can inspire grim changes in even the most noble of men."
241559 "I can only pray that for every haughty Sargon, there will be a humble Ushar, guided not by delusions of grandeur – but by a simple conscience of what is right and what is wrong."

Antigonus, however, will not respond to such calls from a subordinate.\n\n3.Remember that you only have to focus on the enemy facing you to complete your objectives; your allies will take care of the rest, unless they explicitly ask for your help.\n\n4. The Macedonian army's greatest strength is its heavy infantry, which have better line of sight and more pierce armor than those of their opponents."
82009 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Pyrrhus (Green) and a small force have been tasked with delivering supplies to the Antigonids. He will take command of the right flank of the allied army once the battle begins.\n\n- Demetrius (Purple) commands the center-right of the allied army. He trusts in your skill to command and will send his soldiers where you ask. His army consists of a mix of infantry and cavalry.\n\n- Antigonus (Blue) is the leader of your faction. His forces occupy the left and center of the allied base and will do the heavy fighting on those fronts. His armies mainly consist of powerful Macedonian infantry.\n\n- On the enemy side, Seleucus (Red) has taken command of the second line. From his base at the rear of the enemy position, he will send his cavalry and bowmen towards all fronts, including yours.\n\n- In front of him, Lysimachus (Cyan) commands the first line of the enemy army.  His Greek infantry are the most advanced enemy units and will be a tough match for Antigonus, but he will likely not advance on your position.\n\n- Finally, Seleucus' son Antiochus (Orange) commands the eastern flank of the enemy army, right in front of where you are camped. His powerful cavalry will be your primary concern."

82020 "<BLUE>Antigonus: Keep up the pressure, men! We will have these dogs on the run before long!"
82021 "<BLUE>Antigonus: This is getting us nowhere. Pull back and form defensive lines! Once Pyrrhus has cleared the eastern flank, we will charge again and envelop the enemy!"

82103 "Antipater"
82104 "Lysimachus"
82105 "Demetrius"
82106 "Epirus"
82108 "1. Pyrrhus is limited to the Bronze Age and a population of 100.\n\n2. Taking on Neoptolemus' army is the most direct approach, but by destroying his towers you can keep his army alive for the battles to come and loot resources from the rubble.\n\n3. Neoptolemus will initially be slow to react, as he does not expect an attack at night. However, if you delay the attack until morning, you will have more time to explore the potential avenues of attack.\n\n4. You can ally with any of Lysimachus, Antipater or Alexander V, or wage war on them all. However, once you establish an alliance, expect the other two factions to join forces against you.\n\n5. Only maintain an alliance if it furthers your goals. If you need to destroy an allied Town Center to win, you can always break the alliance.\n\n6. Although Demetrius is away on campaign in the east, his gaze will likely soon return to Macedon. Do not neglect to prepare your eastern flank for the coming conflict.\n\n7. Macedonian siege engines come at a discount. Use these to knock down enemy Town Centers!"
82109 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Pyrrhus (Green) has arrived from Egypt and is poised to retake his throne in Epirus. Once the kingdom is back under his control, he must cow the squabbling rulers of Macedon.\n\n- The usurper Neoptolemus (Red) still rules in Epirus. He has learned of Pyrrhus' departure from Egypt and has ordered his guards to watch for any approaching ships.\n\n- To the east of Epirus lies Macedon, which is split between three warring rulers. Alexander V (Yellow) rules the heartland. He is the weakest of the three, but will provide you with resources if you ally with him.\n\n- In the south, his brother and rival Antipater (Blue) is locked in conflict with Alexander’s forces. His fleet rules the waves and siding with him could open up the sea for your ships to navigate freely.\n\n- To the north lies the realm of Lysimachus (Cyan). This confidant of Alexander the Great has the most powerful land army of the three. Siding with him could allow you to attack Macedon from two fronts.\n\n- While he has yet to enter the conflict, Demetrius (Purple) still has a stronghold in the east from which he could launch a full-scale invasion of Macedon. Expect him to field an army of Cavalry and Iron Age heavy infantry."
82110 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Neoptolemus has set his guards on high alert. Let us seek out the weakest point in his defense and launch our attack there!"
82111 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Make quick work of these guards! Epirus will be ours again before Neoptolemus knows what hit him!"
82112 "<GREEN>Epirote Soldier: The sun has almost risen over the mountains, your highness! If we do not land now, we will lose the element of surprise!"
82113 "<RED>Neoptolemus: Has Pyrrhus already landed!? To arms, men, to arms!"
82114 "<RED>Neoptolemus: Pyrrhus is here! Protect the shoreline!"
82115 "<RED>Neoptolemus: This senseless bloodshed must come to an end lest Epirus be reduced to rubble. I am willing to share the throne with you, Pyrrhus, for the good of our people."
82116 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: We have retaken my old kingdom, but this is only the beginning. The time has come to expand our domain into Macedon!"
82117 "<GREEN>Epirote Soldier: Dark tidings, your highness! It appears that your old friend Demetrius plans to take Macedon for himself. His armies will soon arrive from the east!"
82118 "<GREEN>Epirote Soldier: My lord, Macedon is divided among several factions. We could take advantage of these divisions and take them out one by one... or we could ally with one of them against the other two."
82119 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Why would I share yet another throne and become supreme ruler of neither kingdom? No, we will go into this war alone."
82120 "<YELLOW>Alexander V: I would be happy to ally with you, Pyrrhus! My brother Antipater murdered our mother and took the throne for himself... that was my plan and that fiend just stole it from me!"
82121 "<BLUE>Antipater: Your help is welcome, Pyrrhus. Let us seal this alliance with the blood of our enemies!"
82122 "<AQUA>Lysimachus: Very well – if you are building an alliance to seize Macedon, I will simply have to do the same!"
82123 "<AQUA>Lysimachus: It was not so long ago that we stood on opposing sides on the battlefield, young Pyrrhus, but I am happy to put old grievances aside for the moment. Let us split Macedon between us!"
82124 "<BLUE>Antipater: We are now surrounded on all sides by enemies. What say you, Alexander? Shall we set aside our petty squabbles until we have weathered this threat?"
82125 "<YELLOW>Alexander V: I would not call killing our mother and stealing my throne 'petty squabbles'... but you are right, brother. For now, let us make peace."
82126 "<BLUE>Antipater: I was too preoccupied fighting my brother to notice the threat that you posed, Pyrrhus. I go to my end, but I expect you to rule well in my stead."
82127 "<YELLOW>Alexander V: Curse you, Pyrrhus! This is not how this was supposed to end!"
82128 "<BLUE>Antipater: I am undone by my idiot brother and some goatherd from the armpit of the world... how could this happen!?"
82129 "<AQUA>Lysimachus: Your prowess in battle is impressive – that much I will give you, Pyrrhus – but this is not the end. The throne of Macedon will yet be mine!"
82130 "<AQUA>Lysimachus: Macedon is at peace once again. Pyrrhus, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!"
82131 "<AQUA>Lysimachus: And here I was amassing an army to stab you in the back! Ah well, let the best man win!"
82132 "<GREEN>Epirote Soldier: Your highness! We have uncovered a plot by Neoptolemus to poison you! Apparently he plans to take Epirus for himself!"
82133 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: If information like this can leak so easily from his camp, then surely he does not inspire much loyalty in his subjects. Let us strike at him first and give the people of Epirus a proper ruler to look up to!"
82134 "<RED>Neoptolemus: I am shocked and appalled by this sudden betrayal, but no matter. You will regret the day that you returned to Epirus!"
82135 "<RED>Neoptolemus: What are your soldiers doing standing around in my camp?"
82136 "<RED>Neoptolemus: You discovered my plot, eh? Very well, if I cannot kill you with poison, I shall do so with sword and spear. Epirus is mine, and mine alone!"
82137 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Neoptolemus is no more! I should have dealt with that honorless cur long ago."
82138 "<GREEN>Epirote Soldier: Demetrius' army has left port, your highness! They will arrive at our shores in less than five minutes!"
82139 "<PURPLE>Demetrius: It is a shame that we had to reunite under circumstances such as these, yet here you are trying to claim a throne that is mine by right. You leave me no choice but to declare war!"
82140 "<PURPLE>Demetrius: It seems that I underestimated you, old friend! Ah well, I would have needed a ward for this land when I returned to the east for the next campaign season, anyway. I will allow you to keep Macedon... for now!"
82141 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Victory is ours!"
82142 "+ Take control of Epirus either by reducing Neoptolemus to 5 soldiers, or by destroying his 4 Guard Towers."

82208 "1. Pyrrhus begins in the Bronze Age and can support a population of 60 without Houses. Liberating local settlements will increase your population limit.\n\n2. Most of the Epirote army was scattered by a storm and did not reach Italy with Pyrrhus. You may be able to find remnants of this force along the coast.\n\n3. You are entirely reliant on your allies for resources. As such, you cannot train Villagers or construct any buildings beyond those that you capture. The more Greek settlements that you liberate, the more resources you will receive.\n\n4. The Roman army already besieges Heraclea, which is sure to fall if you do not send help.\n\n5. Like the Macedonians, the Romans field powerful infantry. Sometimes you must fight fire with fire."
82209 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Pyrrhus (Green) and the remnants of his army have landed near Tarentum. He must quickly save the town from its Roman besiegers and then battle the Romans across the Italian countryside.\n\n- The Greek colony of Tarentum (Cyan) is your main ally. It will supply you with resources, but is too weak to field its own army.\n\n- Spread across the Italian countryside are various Greek settlements (Grey), which will welcome any liberator who drives their Roman occupiers out.\n\n- To the south lies the Greek town of Heraclea (Blue), which is besieged by the Romans and cannot aid you until they are driven away.\n\n- The Roman army (Red) is deployed near Heraclea and Asculum and will be your most dangerous opponent. It fields a mixed army mostly consisting of heavy infantry.\n\n- To the north lies the Roman town of Asculum (Purple), which supplies the Roman army. Attacking the city could interrupt its resource shipments and prevent the Roman army from training more soldiers.\n\n- To the west lies the realm of the Samnites (Yellow), who have long been a thorn in Rome's side and would welcome an ally against their old rivals.\n\n- Lastly, a contingent of Roman raiders (Orange) has been spotted to the northwest.  While not an immediate threat, they could wreak havoc on your rear when you march to meet the main Roman army at Asculum."
82210 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Our forces were scattered by the storm, but we cannot go looking for survivors yet. We must hurry to Tarentum before the Romans assault the town!"
82211 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Tarentum has been overrun! We were too late to stop the assault!"
82212 "<AQUA>Tarentum: Your arrival is timely, my lord. The main Roman army has laid siege to our allies in Heraclea. We will provide you with whatever resources we can spare if you drive these barbarians out of Megale Hellas!"
82213 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: These Romans build organized camps and deploy their armies in neat formations... they do not seem like barbarians to me."
82214 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Many of the smaller Greek settlements in Italy are under siege, and some have already fallen to the Romans. If we are to win this war, we must liberate as many as we can."
82215 "<GREY>Greek Colonist: Free at last! You can count on us to support the war effort!"
82216 "<GREY>Greek Colonist: About time, I say! These Romans have been loitering all over our pristine streets for years now!"
82217 "<GREEN>Epirote Soldier: We have captured another Greek settlement!"
82218 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: With supplies now coming in from so many Greek towns, we can equip our forces with even better weapons and gear."

82222 "<RED>Consul Laevinus: The time has come! Let us show these decadent colonizers the true might of Rome!"
82223 "<AQUA>Tarentum: Heraclea is lost! You have failed us, Pyrrhus!"
82224 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Heraclea is saved, but the Romans still control a camp near Asculum.  Let us march north and defeat them in their own backyard!"
82225 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Without a camp close to the Romans, our reactions will be slow. Let us clear a way to Asculum and establish a forward base!"
82226 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: From this camp we can strike at the Roman army!"
82227 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: Let us see how Romans fight without their rations!"
82228 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: The Romans are sending raiders towards our position. We may have to deal with them, unless we want them at our backs when we face the brunt of Laevinus' army."
82229 "<GREEN>Pyrrhus: We have captured stolen loot from the raiders' camp!"
82230 "<YELLOW>Samnite Meddix: We Samnites have fought the Romans for generations and would be happy to lend you our support. We ask only that you clear out the Romans occupying our capital!"

The Carthaginians do not yet consider you a serious threat. Use this opportunity to quickly help your Greek allies.\n\n4. Command your allies in Syracuse to attack by placing flares on the map.\n\n5. Your enemies can support larger populations than you. To offset this, liberate local Sicilian towns, which will support you with resources.\n\n6. The Mamertines keep the loot stolen from Sicilian locals stored in Supply Depots that dot the countryside. Destroy these to take the loot for yourself.\n\n7. The Carthaginian holdings are well fortified. Use your discounted siege engines to overcome them!"
82309 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Pyrrhus (Green) has established a small base in Sicily from which he intends to strike out at the Mamertines and Carthaginians controlling most of the island.\n\n- In the east lies the last free Greek town of Syracuse (Orange). It will provide you with resources and help you against the Carthaginians, but expects you to do the heavy lifting.\n\n- Scattered across the island are various Sicilian towns (Grey) occupied by the Mamertines (Blue), a renegade band of mercenaries hailing from Italy. Much like you, the Mamertines were once invited by the Greek cities as protectors, but they soon turned to raiding them instead. The Mamertines guard their hoards fiercely, but are unlikely to stray far from them.\n\n- To the south lies Lilybaeum (Cyan), a town under Carthaginian control. It will be one of your chief opponents and send forth armies consisting of archers and siege engines.\n\n- The Carthaginian army (Purple) camps to the west. This powerful enemy will try to drive you out with armies of cavalry and infantry.\n\n- Carthaginian Suppliers (Yellow) support your enemies, but are weakly defended. Taking them out would cripple the enemy war effort."

82314 "<ORANGE>Syracuse: We asked you here as a liberator, and yet you left us to die at the hands of the Carthaginians? Trusting you was a terrible mistake."

82318 "<GREY>Sicilian Villager: You have our thanks, my lord. These mercenaries have pestered us for far too long. We will give you what little we can, and I am sure that the nearby villages will do the same!"
82319 "<BLUE>Mamertine Raider: We had these poor Sicilians' wealth well protected in our stores, and then you came along and stole it from us – I mean, from them! What a disgrace!"

They have shored up their defenses and will defend their town fiercely.\n\n- Meanwhile, the Samnites (Yellow) have suffered at Roman hands in your absence. They still regard you as an ally, but they will require support to survive.\n\n- The main threat comes from the Roman army (Red) which controls most of northern and northwestern Italy. It will strike hard at you and Tarentum from well defended war camps with armies mainly of heavy infantry.\n\n- Behind the Roman lines lies the city of Beneventum (Orange), which supplies the Romans with resources and wishes to bring the conflict to a quick end."

242101 "How can a man make a name for himself when titans roam the stage of the world? When the heirs of Alexander the Great fight over who will succeed the greatest conqueror there ever was?"
242102 "My friend and master often asks me this question, and I always give him the same answer: searching for greatness in this way is folly. One can only become content by refusing to give in to such desires."
242103 "Pyrrhus, of course, politely calls me an idiot when I say this, if not by that exact word. For him, carving a legacy is the one thing that truly gives life meaning. He says, 'a man must fight unrelentingly to become stronger than all others, until he finds himself alone on the throne of the world – just as Alexander did.'"
242104 "To which I politely reply that he is an idiot, if not by that exact word."
242105 "Pyrrhus was born on the edge of the thunderous storm that is Greek politics. At a young age, he was placed on the throne of Epirus, a small mountain kingdom on the fringe of the civilized world. But before he could get used to how the crown felt upon his head, it was ripped away."
242106 "The Epirotes rose up in rebellion against their young monarch and installed a man named Neoptolemus on the throne. He was a murderous, small-minded man who would sell his own mother for another province to rule."
242107 "In other words, he was just the sort of unremarkable ruler that the people desired."
242108 "Landless and crownless, Pyrrhus was forced to escape to the east. Here he joined the court of his brother-in-law Demetrius, whose father Antigonus was quickly becoming the most powerful of Alexander’s successors."
242109 "Antigonus' growing power alarmed the others. From all over Alexander’s broken empire, they now joined forces against him."
242110 "The two great armies met near the town of Ipsus in the heart of Antigonus' realm. Serving as one of Demetrius’ commanders, Pyrrhus finally found a chance to test his mettle."
242151 "Despite having never lost a battle during his eighty years on Earth, Antigonus lost both the war and his life at Ipsus."
242152 "The retreat left Pyrrhus sour. He had routed the enemy on his flank, impressing his superiors with his courage – and yet, it was all for naught."
242153 "For a time, Pyrrhus wondered if he had tied himself to a sinking ship, yet he remained loyal to Demetrius. In time, that loyalty would pay off – but not in the way that he had expected."

242201 "For most people, war is like a bad marriage: an unending affair of strife, bitterness, and glimmering moments of joy that serve only to prolong the suffering. But for Pyrrhus, fighting came as naturally as breathing."
242202 "Following a war between Demetrius and the king of Egypt, Pyrrhus was sent to the desert kingdom as a hostage. Here, his luck finally returned."
242203 "His many war stories made an impression on the Egyptian king – as did his ability to laugh off any insult thrown at him. With such a capable friend in his court, the king sensed an opportunity. He equipped Pyrrhus with a small army and the ships needed to transport it to Epirus, hoping to forge in him an ally on the Greek mainland."
242204 "The prospect of retaking Epirus thrilled Pyrrhus – as did the chance to exploit the chaos in nearby Macedon to seize both realms for himself. At long last, the exiled king was returning home."
242251 "Had the struggle for Macedon been a play, it would have been booed out of the theatre for its confusing, overlapping plotlines. Stories, after all, should be simple, straightforward, and with an entertaining hero to cheer for; all of the things that real politics lack."
242252 "At the end of the war, Pyrrhus came to blows with his old master Demetrius. Each led their forces against the other – and, in what must have been an act of divine mischief, the two armies marched right past each other."
242253 "As Demetrius raided across Epirus, a second army commanded by his finest general, Pantauchus, met Pyrrhus in battle. Pantauchus challenged the Epirote king to a duel – and Pyrrhus accepted."
242254 "With thousands of men watching and cheering for their leaders, the two commanders fought man against man. Swords clashed, shields buckled, and for a short while, the brutality of the war was distilled into the shapes of those men, those two kingdoms personified."
242255 "Pantauchus managed a single strike on Pyrrhus; but not long after, Pyrrhus wounded his opponent in the thigh and neck."
242256 "Pantauchus was forced to retreat and Pyrrhus claimed victory. His boldness earned him the nickname “The Eagle”, but his triumph proved hollow when the war ended in a stalemate. For all his efforts, Pyrrhus returned to Epirus empty-handed."

242301 "Pyrrhus now had neither enemies to fight, nor pressing disputes to manage. It was the first period of prolonged peace that he had experienced in many years..."
242302 "...and he hated every minute of it. Men like him are built for war, and they start to break down come peacetime. Pyrrhus was looking for any excuse to rally his men again – and he soon found one."
242303 "The Greek colonies in Italy had long been regarded as unimportant outposts in barbarian lands, but now they were under threat from the ever-expanding republic of Rome. When a call for aid came from the city-state of Tarentum, Pyrrhus jumped at the opportunity."
242304 "All that I could do was try and convince him to stay and enjoy his hard-won peace. 'If we can conquer Rome,' he told me as he was drawing up his invasion plans, 'all of Italy will soon be ours. And if we can defeat the Romans, then Sicily, Libya, and Carthage should be easy pickings.'"
242305 "'And when all of these lands are yours, what will you do?' I asked. He replied, 'Why, we will celebrate, of course! We will sing and drink and be at ease after all of our troubles!'"
242306 "'Then what, pray tell, is preventing us from drinking and passing our time right now, instead of starting yet another war? If happiness and celebration is your goal, my friend, then you have already achieved it!'"
242307 "Pyrrhus could give no good answer, but his mind was already set. He would become the liberator of the Greeks in Italy and put the Roman barbarians in their place."
242308 "However, a raging storm hit our fleet as we sailed for Italy. With his army scattered to the winds, Pyrrhus made landfall near Tarentum with only a fraction of the men that he had assembled."
242351 "At Heraclea, the Romans fled in panic before Pyrrhus’ war elephants. When we fought them again at Asculum, they had already adapted to this strange new weapon, and they sent out twin chariots with long ropes between them to down the fearsome creatures."
242352 "The Italian expedition never became the quick victory that Pyrrhus had hoped for. The Tarentines seemed content to let him do their fighting for them, and while he bested the Romans twice in battle, each victory came at the cost of thousands of his best men."
242353 "'One more victory like this and I will be undone,' he told me at one point, and I feared that it was true. Yet he refused to give up hope."
242354 "Pyrrhus' ambition was to build a western empire from which he would conquer all of Alexander’s old domains. If Italy could not be easily cowed, he would simply have to turn elsewhere."

242401 "Despite suffering two crushing defeats, the Romans quickly recouped their strength. They refused to sign any peace treaty so long as Pyrrhus remained in Italy."
242402 "Seeing no clear way forward, Pyrrhus turned his gaze to Sicily. Much like in Italy, the Greek colonies here were threatened by foreign invasion, this time from the Carthaginian Empire and its Mamertine allies."
242403 "Carthage had dominated the western sea for centuries with its wealth and vast mercenary armies. Despite this, its grip on Sicily was tenuous, as the rugged island was difficult for any conqueror to hold."
242404 "But if any man could succeed in ruling Sicily, Pyrrhus reasoned that it would be him."
242451 "Pyrrhus had bested another great empire, yet as so many times before, his victory was short-lived."
242452 "As the war dragged on, he became increasingly suspicious of the Greeks who had called him there. Their refusal to give everything to the war effort was, in his mind, akin to treason."
242453 "When he executed one of the men who had invited him to Sicily in the first place, the public turned against him. Pyrrhus, they claimed, had become just the sort of tyrant they had wanted to escape."
242454 "With the entire island in revolt, it seemed that Pyrrhus was out of options."

242501 "Just as one door slammed shut, another opened – and Pyrrhus was quick to jump through it."
242502 "While he had been occupied in Sicily, the Romans had regrouped and once more set their sights on Tarentum. Desperate for help, the Greeks called on Pyrrhus, the only ruler who had ever answered their pleas."
242503 "With Sicily lost, and the Mamertines and the Carthaginian fleet shadowing his every move, Pyrrhus set out for Italy. Yet, after so many hard-won victories that had spilled out in the sand, doubt gnawed at him. He had bested the Romans before, and he could do it again – but at what cost?"
242504 "Like Sisyphus in the old tales, he had been rolling his rock up the hill over and over, only for it to tumble back down and for the challenge to begin anew."
242505 "Perhaps he would be satisfied once he had beaten the Romans a third time. Perhaps he would then return to Epirus and live out his days in peace."
242506 "Perhaps..."
242551 "Despite the Epirotes' valiant efforts, the battle of Beneventum was ultimately a failure. The Romans had learned from Pyrrhus' battle tactics and they managed to scare the enemy war elephants into stampeding into the Epirote lines."
242552 "Pyrrhus was forced to retreat. After five years of campaigning, all that he could do was to leave the Greek colonies to their fate. The Romans were relieved. Pyrrhus had been the fiercest opponent that they had ever faced, and they were honored to have fought such a powerful foe."
242553 "As we set sail for Epirus, Pyrrhus and I took to conversing on the ship’s deck. I told him that he reminded me of the myth of Sisyphus, and he, as he so often did, simply laughed it off."
242554 "'You still do not understand, do you, Cineas?' he said. 'I will never stop struggling. To do so is to give up on life.'"
242555 "'You call it a curse, to push that rock up the hill forever and ever – but it is no curse. It is the one thing that a man can do when faced with impossible odds. It is his sole recourse in a universe that could not care less about his wishes.'"
242556 "'Perhaps it is pointless in the end,' he said, 'and perhaps I will die before achieving what I set out to do. It does not matter. If you give up on your ambitions, then you might as well be dead – for you are already dead inside.'"
242557 "I listened closely to him. As he finished, and as the coast of Epirus appeared to rise out of the waves far ahead, I could not help but smile."
242558 "'You are an idiot, my friend,' I told him, if not by those exact words."

Roman buildings are cheap. Once you unlock more military buildings, do not be shy about constructing forward bases.\n\n4.

His infantry, mounted units, and siege engines will navigate along the Tigris River.\n\n- Several Mesopotamian enclaves (Grey) lie along the Euphrates and Tigris and could serve as valuable launching pads for further attacks.\n\n- They are guarded by a variety of Parthian troops (Cyan).\n\n- The Parthian capital of Ctesiphon (Blue) dominates the southeast of the map.

243101 "My grandfather once told me of the age of Augustus, the emperor who found Rome a city of brick, and left it one of marble."
243102 "Guided by his virtue and prudence, Augustus’ empire reached new bounds. A vast constellation of cities spanning the Mediterranean and beyond, its prosperity and happiness were the envy of an otherwise bitter, cruel world."
243103 "Seven decades, ten emperors, and countless civil wars later, that golden age is a distant memory. Marred by corruption, the constellation that once lit the world is now little more than a faint and fraudulent zodiac."
243104 "Yet, there are those among us who still believe in Rome."
243105 "In my youth, I followed my father’s and grandfather’s footsteps into the legions. Twenty years later, I am Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commander of the Seventh Legion, and a veteran of Emperor Domitian’s northern wars."
243106 "The aristocrats of the senate despise Domitian for his unwillingness to bend to their whims, but he treats his legions well. Now, he calls on us to quash the rebellion of one Saturninus, a provincial governor styling himself Emperor."
243107 "A lifelong military man, I know all too well that soldiers’ blood is the currency of rich men’s power plays – but when Rome calls, I must go."
243108 "I will march north to see that this civil war ends before it has even begun."
243151 "We Romans say that fortune favors the bold, but how does it decide between two valiant men? The question puzzled me as my men dragged Saturninus before our merciless emperor."
243152 "I wonder what his last thoughts were. Did he regret not anticipating that my legions would reach the front in time? Did he curse fortune for the unprecedented January thaw that prevented his German allies from crossing the Rhine?"
243153 "It matters not; the answer died with him – but our emperor’s anger endured."
243154 "From the day of his coronation, Domitian had been a firm and bold ruler, but the senate despised this friend of the legionary and the commoner. When Domitian’s latent paranoia began to consume him, his wrath engulfed the empire like a raging wildfire."
243155 "Countless arrests followed in the wake of the war. Senators who had opposed him were executed like common criminals."
243156 "When the court could bear it no more, the emperor was assassinated."

243201 "Domitian’s successor was a good man but a poor ruler. Nevertheless, he shared my loyalty to Rome, and sought to reverse the damage that Domitian’s folly had done."
243202 "With no sons to pass the mantle to, Emperor Nerva named me as his heir before striding on into the afterlife after two short years on the throne."
243203 "The immense honor of steering the might of Rome is matched only by the weight of its responsibility. I am a general, not a senator – my mind is built for the straightforwardness of the battlefield, not the intricacies of politics!"
243204 "I can – and I must – learn to be a politician, but in the meanwhile I should play to my strengths. The divided Roman people need a common enemy, and I will give them that."
243205 "North of the Danube lies Dacia, a barbarous kingdom – but one also rich in gold and silver. Its wily king Decebalus once played Domitian for a fool, negotiating an unfavorable treaty that tarnished Roman imperial repute."
243206 "My loyal cousin Hadrian will join me on this campaign and learn from my example! I will unite the Roman people, take vengeance on a haughty foe, and enrich our struggling economy all in one fell swoop."
243251 "Peace between Dacia and Rome was the story of one man’s panic and another’s bluff. As Decebalus saw my legions thrust into his realm and capture his sister, he must have feared that the end was near."
243252 "Yet, my imperious tone and stern demands during the negotiations were a mere facade. With only a few legions on the front, I knew in my heart that I lacked the strength to overthrow Decebalus today, but he did not."
243253 "For now, the conman has been beaten at his own game, but I know better than to trust a cornered wolf. As we march home after a draining campaign, I have tasked my best architects with building a bridge across the Danube into Dacia."
243254 "If Decebalus shows even a hint of treachery, my legions will now have a direct route to his front door."

243301 "A tiger does not change its stripes. No sooner was I home than the Dacian king began to plot against me, his rightful overlord."
243302 "I bided my time, preparing my forces and learning the other side of rulership – being a friend to the senate and the people of Rome. Yet when news spread of a hostile alliance beyond the Danube, I kept a watchful eye on Dacia..."
243303 "...and when my guards caught would-be assassins sent forth by the Dacian king, I knew to expect war at any moment."
243304 "This campaign will be different from the last. The Dacians know they cannot face Hadrian and I in the field, so they will hide in their mountain fortresses, hoping for us to tire and leave."
243305 "Amateurs speak of strategy and tactics, while professionals look to logistics. Dacia will not be conquered by a decisive battle – it will be conquered because Hadrian and I can sustain fourteen legions and strip the Dacian forces of their supplies."
243306 "Decebalus, my false friend – heads will roll."
243351 "To the onlookers that had gathered, I appeared to take my success modestly, acting like I had been there before – but inside, my heart swelled with pride as I rode through the gates of Rome in triumph. To be loved by one is gratifying enough; to be loved by thousands is indescribable."
243352 "The mob roared as Decebalus’ head was thrown to the dogs, commencing over a hundred days of celebratory festivals and gladiatorial games. Senators greeted me with awe and respect that I knew for once to be genuine; men of all ranks chanted my name."
243353 "The vast Dacian treasure and its plentiful gold mines will offer riches beyond Rome’s wildest dreams. My mind races with thoughts of the greatness that I – and, more importantly, Rome – can achieve with such wealth."
243354 "Still, the age-old maxim echoes through my head: ‘Look behind you! Remember you are just a man.’"

243401 "Many past emperors buckled under the weight of ruling such a large empire because they tried to micromanage it all. From them I have learned a crucial lesson: in Rome, to govern is to delegate."
243402 "Fortitude, ambition, and resolve paved the road to the imperial palace, but it is honor, diligence, and respect that keeps one there. My people respect and care for me because I do the same for them."
243403 "Yet, above all I hold the virtue and dignity of Rome herself most dear. Her prestige grew once more when I incorporated Nabataea as her newest province, but recently came under attack from a predictable direction."
243404 "For decades, an uneasy peace between Rome and rival Parthia was hallowed by joint influence over Armenia, a state that served as little more than a buffer to defuse tensions. Now, the Parthian king Osroes has broken this agreement and seized the land for his own."
243405 "The Parthian army is formidable, but I did not become emperor by building shields after arrows were shot my way. The frontier legions are clamoring for action, and it is about time that we put our nefarious eastern neighbor in its place."
243451 "Despite my hostility towards Parthia, it pains me to fight Osroes. His skill as a commander would be the envy of any leader, yet the discord tormenting his realm overshadows his talents. As he struggles in vain to stave off my invasion, he does so with one hand tied behind his back."
243452 "I see much of myself in him, and he offers a haunting glimpse into an alternate reality where I was born in the wrong place at the wrong time."
243453 "Seizing Armenia was an ambitious move. One could argue that it was an overstep, but did I not do the same, from another point of view, when I took Dacia and Nabataea?"
243454 "I am no warmonger, and I have never loved it, but I cannot lie: on the battlefield, the anxieties of governance fade into the shadows as the simplicities of present survival come to the fore. Life just makes sense out here – and that is a notion that terrifies me."
243455 "Am I a hero or a monster? A genius or a madman?"
243456 "Sometimes, the sole difference is success."

243501 "The pages of history are littered with brilliant victors and foolish losers, but foolish victors and brilliant losers are in much more exclusive company."
243502 "I am not so arrogant as to call myself brilliant – others can do that for me, if they deem it just – but I am no fool, and my instincts have been sharpened by decades of fighting."
243503 "When a shark smells blood in the water, it attacks mercilessly. When news reached me of the civil war in Parthia, I resolved to do the same."
243504 "A pang of pity for Osroes struck me as I recalled the strife of my youth, but now that fortune has given me a chance to put a decisive end to an age-old rivalry, I cannot hesitate."
243505 "Rome knows two great seas today, but tomorrow it will know a third. We will seize Ctesiphon, the jewel of Parthia, and stride onward in the footsteps of Alexander until my legions glimpse the ocean."
243506 "If I succeed, I hope that history will remember Osroes as a brilliant loser – but how will I be remembered? How will Hadrian? How will Rome?"
243551 "Someday, parents will tell children of the age of Trajan, the emperor who found Rome a city of marble, and left it one of gold."
243552 "Ironic, then, that I have no children of my own to tell this tale. I have a loving wife, but in truth, Rome herself has always been the love of my life. Perhaps the gods, in their infinite wisdom, deemed the care of children too much for a man who chose an entire empire as his family."
243553 "Perhaps, as I lie on my deathbed, they are indirectly showing me the way."
243554 "For years, Rome suffered under the yoke of cruel emperors with no merit other than their bloodline. Like Nerva, I will now choose my successor by merit..."
243555 "...and what better choice than Hadrian, the loyal man who walked in my footsteps, learned from my example, and did it all without a single treacherous thought?"
243556 "The afterlife is timeless, immaterial, and boundless. I gaze towards the men tending my funeral pyre, and hear them now call me a god. I look out over the forum that I built, the carved column that tells my story, and the city that is an empire’s beating heart."
243557 "I smile, knowing that I have left these people a better Rome than the one that I found."
243558 "Yet, at the same time, doubt and dread gnaw at me. Now that I have raised the bar, others will try and match it – and their vain ambition, conceit, and impossible expectations could drag Rome towards the same familiar decline from which I rescued it."
243559 "Was I Rome’s savior, or its doom?"

83508 "1. You can support a population of 50.\n\n2. Hunt gazelles and elephants to increase your stockpile of food in order to create new Villagers.\n\n3. To create new units, you must build new Houses to support your growing population.\n\n4. Villagers can move around gazelles and herd them closer to the Town Center before hunting them. This decreases the distance Villagers must travel to drop the meat off at your Town Center.\n\n5. Elephants will attack Villagers hunting them, so instead of herding them like gazelles, you must select a Villager, shoot the elephant, run away, and then (when he's almost out of range) turn your Villager around and shoot it again. Repeat this process to lure the elephant to your Town Center, where you can easily kill it with multiple Villagers, also reducing the distance your Villagers must walk.\n\n6. Food from dead animals decays over time, so minimize waste by assigning multiple Villagers to harvest meat.\n\n7. Beware of crocodiles, which will eat unwary villagers who wander near the shore. Crocodiles and other predators can be hunted, but they provide less food than other animals."
83509 "HUNTING\nTo assign a Villager to hunt, select the Villager, and then right-click an animal, such as a gazelle. The Villager will hunt the animal, gather food, and deposit it at the Town Center, where it is added to your stockpile (visible in the upper-left corner of the game screen).\n\nCREATING VILLAGERS\nVillagers cost food. To create a Villager, select the Town Center, and then select the Create Villager button at the bottom of the game screen. After a brief training period, the Villager appears beside the Town Center. Resources (such as food from hunting) are accumulated faster if you assign newly created Villagers to gather them.\n\nBUILDING HOUSES\nHouses cost wood. Each House supports four units. The Town Center also supports four units. To build a House, select a Villager, select the Build button at the bottom of the game screen, select the Build House button, and then left-click a location on the map. The House is shown in red if you cannot build it in a particular location."

Put the new Villagers to work chopping wood as well as constructing the other required buildings (Storage Pit, Granary, and Dock)\n\n2. Forage sites are plentiful across the river, which you can reach by crossing the shallows.\n\n3. Villagers automatically deposit food from foraging at the Town Center or Granary, whichever is closer. Building a Granary near the forage sites decreases the distance Villagers must travel to drop off the food.\n\n4. Villagers automatically deposit wood at the Town Center or Storage Pit, whichever is closer. Building a Storage Pit near a forest decreases the distance Villagers must travel to drop off the wood."
83539 "GATHERING WOOD\nTo chop wood, select a Villager, and then right-click a tree. The Villager will chop the tree, gather wood, and deposit it at the Town Center or Storage Pit, where it is added to your stockpile.\n\nFORAGING FOR FOOD\nTo forage for food, select a Villager, and then right-click a forage site (berry bush). The Villager will gather food and deposit it at the Town Center or Granary.\n\nCONSTRUCTING BUILDINGS\nIn addition to Houses to support new Villagers, you must also construct a Storage Pit, Granary, and Dock. Before you can construct buildings, you must have enough wood in your stockpile. Like Houses, you can construct other buildings by selecting a Villager, selecting the Build button at the bottom of the game screen, selecting the button of the building you want to build, and then left-clicking a location on the map. If you want to build more than one of the same building, press SHIFT, and then left-click multiple locations on the map."

Remember, to create new Villagers, you must hunt or forage for food and chop wood to build additional Houses to support them.\n\n3. After you have created several Villagers, you can group them and explore the map in search of the five Ruins.\n\n4. If enemy units or predators attack you, retaliate with your group of Villagers, and then resume your search for the Ruins as quickly as possible."
83569 "EXPLORING THE MAP\nTo explore the map, select one or more Villagers and then right-click a location on the map.\n\nSELECTING VILLAGERS\nTo select several Villagers, left-click-and-drag the cursor over the Villagers you want to select (or hold down the CTRL key and select each Villager). If you want to assign them a group hotkey to find them more easily, hold the CTRL key and press a number to assign to the group. The group number appears next to each unit in the group. To select a group, press the number key assigned to that group.\n\nCONTROLLING RUINS\nRuins are ancient structures resembling Stonehenge that were built by now-lost cultures and bring prestige to the civilization that controls them. Ruins are controlled by the last civilization to move a Villager, military unit, or boat nearby, and will take on that civilization's player color. They can be captured by another civilization.

83598 "1. The best way to gather food in this scenario is to fish with Villagers and Fishing Boats. Keep in mind that you must build a Dock to construct Fishing Boats.\n\n2. Fishing Boats collect fish further away from the coast faster than shore fish.\n\n3. Elephants can also be hunted for food.\n\n4. The more Villagers you have chopping wood and the more Fishing Boats you have fishing for food, the faster your stockpiles will grow.\n\n5. Remember to build Houses to support the new Villagers and Fishing Boats you create."
83599 "FISHING\nTo fish, select a Villager, and then right-click a fishing site (jumping fish near shore).\n\nA Fishing Boat can gather more fish than a Villager. To build a Fishing Boat, first build a Dock, then select the Dock, and finally select the Build Fishing Boat button. To fish with a Fishing Boat, select the Fishing Boat, and then right-click a fishing site (jumping fish away from shore).\n\nADVANCING TO THE NEXT AGE\nTo advance from the Stone Age to the Tool Age, you must have a Town Center and at least two different Stone Age buildings (Granary, Storage Pit, Dock, or Barracks). You must also have 500 food stockpiled to advance to the Tool Age. To advance to the next Age, select the Town Center, and then select the Advance to Tool Age button. Advancing to each new Age will unlock new units, buildings, and technologies (as shown on the Technology Tree)."

Use your Axemen for melee combat, and keep the Bowmen behind them to take advantage of their range.\n\n4. Bowmen firing down at the enemy from cliffs or elevation deal extra damage.\n\n5. Try to concentrate your fire on one enemy to kill him quickly."
83629 "REVIEWING YOUR TROOPS\nYou begin this mission with an assortment of military units (four Axemen and three Bowmen). Select a unit to review its capabilities. Its attributes (e.g. hit points, attack strength, armor, pierce armor, range) are shown in the status box in the bottom of the game screen. Axemen have more attack strength than Bowmen, but the Bowmen have range, which allows them to fire on enemies from a distance.\n\nSELECTING MILITARY UNITS\nTo select several military units, left-click-and-drag the cursor over the military units you want to group (or hold down the CTRL key and click each unit).\n\nENGAGING IN COMBAT\nEnemy units become visible when they are within your units' line of sight. They disappear again if they are beyond it. Your units automatically attack any enemy units in sight."

Food sources are limited, so you must build Farms to provide more food.\n\n3. When you have enough wood, consider constructing an Archery Range or Stable and training archers or mounted units to strengthen your ranks of Axemen.\n\n4. To control the Ruin, you must cross the river and venture into the desert. Do not hesitate to battle other Egyptians standing in your way.\n\n5. After you have neutralized or destroyed your enemy and secured the Ruins, you can concentrate on building more Farms to accumulate the food needed to win."
83659 "FARMING\nBefore you can build Farms, you must build a Market. To farm, select a Villager, and then right-click a Farm. The Villager will gather food and deposit it at the Town Center or Granary. Only one Villager can work a Farm. Researching Domestication, Plow, and Irrigation at the Market increases Farm productivity. Farms eventually go fallow and must be resown.\n\nUPGRADING UNITS\nTo upgrade your military units (Clubmen), click the Barracks, and then click the Upgrade to Battle Axe button. This will upgrade your existing Clubmen to stronger Axemen, which you will train instead from then on.\n\nREPAIRING BUILDINGS AND BOATS\nDamaged buildings and boats catch fire. For a cost, Villagers can repair them to full strength. To repair a building or boat, select a Villager, and then right-click the building or boat to repair. More Villagers will repair a building or boat faster."

The most efficient way to accumulate gold is to trade your surplus resources.\n\n3. Build warships at the Dock to clear the seas of pirates preying on Trade Boats and Merchant Ships.\n\n4. Build Farms and produce excess food that you can trade for gold. You can also build Fishing Boats to fish for food. If you want to trade food, be sure to Click the Trade Food for Gold button, otherwise wood is traded by default.\n\n5. If you attack your enemies, leave their Docks intact so you can continue to trade with them. You can build a second Dock on the northeast coast to improve trade and reduce congestion."
83689 "MINING STONE AND GOLD\nTo mine stone or gold, select a Villager, and then right-click a stone mine or a gold mine. The Villager will gather the stone or gold and deposit it at the Town Center or Storage Pit.\n\nTRADING WITH OTHER CIVILIZATIONS\nTrading with other civilizations' Docks or Markets is another way to acquire gold. Trade units (e.g. Trade Boats, Merchant Ships, and Trade Carts) travel to foreign Docks or Markets to sell their goods, and return to your Dock or Market to deposit the gold. The longer the route, the more valuable your cargo and the more gold you receive. Trading has no effect on the player you are trading with. To trade with another civilization, build a Trade Boat, Merchant Ship, or Trade Cart. Select the trade unit, and then right-click the Dock or Market to trade with. Select a trade unit to display its cargo in the status box in the bottom of the game screen.

One possible strategy is to train an army to destroy all units guarding the Stone Thrower before your Priests convert it. Another option is to approach more slowly and use your Priests to convert the enemy guards before converting the Stone Thrower.\n\n4. The enemy has many Bowmen. Slingers are strong against other ranged units such as the Bowman, so train some to protect your Priests."
83719 "CONVERTING ENEMY UNITS\nTo convert an enemy unit, select a Priest, and then right-click the unit to convert. Or select the Convert button, and then select the enemy unit to convert. A successful conversion will bring the unit under your control. Priests must rejuvenate their faith after making a conversion. The rejuvenation percentage is shown in the Priest's status box. Priests do not automatically convert nearby units unless they are attacked. When the Priest has converted a unit, he stands idle until given another command.\n\nYou can improve your Priests by researching technologies at the Temple. Fanaticism lets Priests rejuvenate more quickly. Afterlife increases Priests' conversion range. Astrology lets Priests convert units more quickly. Monotheism lets Priests convert buildings and enemy Priests. A Priest must move adjacent to a building to convert it.\n\nBoats and Chariots are more resistant to conversion than other units. If a Priest converts a Light Transport or Heavy Transport carrying units, the ship is converted but its cargo is not. Converted units maintain their attributes (attack, range, etc.) at conversion; they cannot be upgraded. Priests cannot convert Town Centers, Wonders, or allied assets."

You must advance to the Bronze Age and build a Government Center in order to build a second Town Center.\n\n4. You must build a Transport to carry Villagers to the island to build the Town Center. The island is inhabited by hungry predators, so bring several Villagers and some military units as protection.\n\n5. When the island is free of predators, you can build a Town Center and begin gathering the stone you need to build two Sentry Towers."
83749 "TRANSPORTING UNITS ACROSS WATER\nVillagers, military units, and Artifacts can board a transport vessel and travel across water. Allied units can also be transported. Each transport vessel can only carry a limited number of Villagers, military units, and Artifacts at once.\n\nTo load a transport vessel, build a Light Transport or Heavy Transport at the Dock, select the unit to load, and then right-click the transport vessel.\n\nTo unload a transport vessel, select the transport vessel, select the Unload button at the bottom of the game screen, and then left-click a location on shore or in shallows."

Woodcutting technologies not only improve your wood gathering rate, but also increase the range of your ships, towers, and ranged land units.\n\n5.

You need only to fight your way into the center of the Libyan town, capture the Artifact, and bring it back to your Town Center. You do not need to destroy all Libyan units and buildings.\n\n7. Mine the gold near your Town Center to research technologies at the Storage Pit that will improve your soldiers' fighting abilities."
83779 "RESEARCHING TECHNOLOGY\nAdvancing through the Ages unlocks new technologies for you to research. Refer to the Technology Tree for information about the technologies available in each Age. Researching technology takes time and costs resources, but each technology researched immediately benefits your civilization and allows you to keep pace with your opponents.\nTo research a technology, select a building, and then select the button in the bottom of the screen that corresponds to the technology you want to research.\n\nCONTROLLING ARTIFACTS\nArtifacts are objects akin to the Ark of the Covenant that were crafted by now-lost cultures and bring prestige to the civilization that possesses them. An Artifact is controlled by the last civilization to move a Villager, military unit, or boat nearby, and will take on that civilization's player color. Artifacts can be captured by other civilizations and carried away, on land or on a transport vessel. Artifacts cannot be destroyed. If a transport vessel sinks with an Artifact on board, the Artifact appears on a nearby shore."

A large deposit of stone is located on an island in the far east corner of the map. Transport Villagers to the island and build a Storage Pit or Town Center there.\n\n3. Gold is located in the far west corner of the map, but it is heavily defended by the Canaanites and may not be worth the risk. Allied docks are located to the southeast if you want to trade instead. Build fishing boats to fish for food you can then trade for gold. You may want to save your stone and wood because you need them to build the Wonder.\n\n4. Build up your defenses early – you will probably be attacked quickly. Create a small army to defend against troops landing on your shores, and build a small armada to defend against enemy ships."
83809 "BUILDING WONDERS\nA Wonder is a civilization's crowning achievement. Examples of ancient Wonders that have become icons for their civilization are the Egyptian Pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and the Athenian Parthenon.

244101 "Island in the Nile Delta, 8000 BCE"
244102 "Egypt is a land blessed with plentiful plants and wildlife, making it an excellent place to settle your wandering tribe of hunters and gatherers. Even though your people have primitive technology and rely on stone tools, they are skilled hunters."
244103 "Establish a small village on this Nile Delta island and grow your tribe to seven people."

244106 "Nile Delta, 6500 BCE"
244107 "For generations, the rich hunting lands along the Nile have provided for your people. Now, a series of droughts have withered the size of the herds and forced your kin to forage for new food sources. Fortunately, the banks of the Nile teem with fruits and edible plants."
244108 "Hunting bands have returned from the east with berries, dates, and leeks. Find these forage sites and collect food for your growing tribe. Once you have enough food, settle in this rich area by constructing a Granary, Storage Pit, and Dock."

244111 "Nile Delta, 6200 BCE"
244112 "As your hunters venture out, they begin to encounter other cultures to the west, along the Mediterranean Coast. You have sent parties of explorers to search the borderlands to learn about these people whom you call Libyans. "
244113 "According to legends, there are sacred sites nearby. Find the five discoveries before the encroaching Libyans do."

244116 "Nile River bank, around 6000 BCE"
244117 "Exploration and contact with other cultures have brought new ideas to Egypt. Your people are learning new skills, including technologies for fishing and more complex stone tools. "
244118 "Advance your culture to the Tool Age to gain access to these skills and new capabilities."

244121 "Lower Egypt, around 3800 BCE"
244122 "New technologies have allowed your tribe to grow but have also brought conflicts. The spread of the Sahara's sands has forced neighboring tribes to migrate into your lands to seize control of your foraging sites and defensive positions."
244123 "Raiding parties from Upper Egypt have come down the river. Intercept and destroy these invaders before they infiltrate your villages and steal your food supplies."

244126 "Nile Valley, around 3100 BCE"
244127 "The future of Egypt is about to change. The great pharaoh Narmer seeks to unite the Upper and Lower Kingdoms into a unified Egypt. Using the wealth brought from farming along the Nile's banks, he will finally be able to defeat his rivals."
244128 "Take control of the villages along the river and build a surplus of 800 food to feed your people and Narmer's warriors. In addition, take control of the ancient stone circle of Nabta Playa, found in the desert to the west."
244129 "Controlling this ancient ruin will demonstrate Narmer's power to his opponents. Be wary of nearby peoples, however. You need not destroy them, but know that they will attempt to undermine Narmer's goal of uniting Egypt."

244131 "Mediterranean, around 2700 BCE"
244132 "The reputation of a united Egypt is spreading to all corners of the world and trade has vastly increased your people's wealth. With this prosperity, the pharaoh Djoser has decided that a mere mastaba, a simple mud tomb, will not be enough to serve him in the afterlife. "
244133 "Instead, he has ordered the architect Imhotep to design a stepped pyramid that will be visible from miles away. Such a large project will require great resources. You have been ordered to go to the north and set up a trade post to collect the gold for the pyramid."
244134 "At the same time, you must venture into the desert and find a quarry to supply stone for the construction. Your trading partners, the Minoans, Canaanites, and Libyans, could become jealous of Egypt's success and might even cease trade and attack your people. "
244135 "In case our diplomats fail to keep the peace, you must defend your trade ships. The pharaoh is entrusting you with the success of this project."

244136 "Heliopolis, around 2500 BCE"
244137 "Egyptian culture is flourishing and the population is growing. In order to provide for the administration of the kingdom and serve the gods, new professions have been established. Scribes and priests help the pharaoh in his dealings with the military, the people, and the gods."
244138 "These new specialists have quickly gained prominence and become vital to Egyptian civilization. In the north, west of the Nile Delta, scouts report Libyan raiding parties are approaching one of Egypt's most sacred cities, Heliopolis, built to honor the sun god Ra."
244139 "As the lector priest of the city's main temple and army scribe of the pharaoh, you are commanded to stop these raiders at all costs. The priests in the city have offered their services to support the army. "
244140 "However, you must be wary of the Libyans who bring a siege engine with them to demolish the city's walls. This machine could be useful for our own armies, so instead of destroying it, the pharaoh has ordered you to capture this Stone Thrower and bring it to the Town Center at Heliopolis."

244141 "The Fourth Cataract, 1878-1860 BCE"
244142 "For centuries, the Nubians of the south have attacked and pillaged our cities in Upper Egypt. Pharaoh Senusret III is determined to deal with them for good."
244143 "His plan is to subdue Lower Nubia by building forts along the Nile River all the way to the Fourth Cataract (rapids or waterfalls on the Nile River, impassable by boat). To the south of your position, there is an island on the Nile which would be an ideal location for such a fort."
244144 "Explore the island, clear it of enemies, and build a Town Center and two Sentry Towers there."

244146 "Nile Delta, 1720 BCE"
244147 "The forts along the Nile have brought peace to the south, but the Libyans have once again become a problem. They have been raiding the coasts and intercepting trade ships bringing goods from other lands to Egypt."
244148 "Recently, they captured an important ship belonging to the pharaoh himself, and carried off a treasured artifact sent to him by the kings of Canaan."
244149 "Build a naval base in this area of the coast and attack the Libyan raiders in the Nile Delta. Recover the stolen artifact and return it to your Town Center."

244151 "Karnak, 1490 – 1460 BCE"
244152 "Our people have endured many dark nights, but finally Egypt awakens to the dawn of a new era. The pharaohs have driven out the foreign invaders and secured Egypt's borders. The reigning pharaoh, Queen Hatshepsut, promises to be one of the greatest rulers of this land."
244153 "She has already extended the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor, but her ambition knows no bounds. She plans to construct an even larger temple called Djeser-Djeseru, the 'holy of holies,' and has given you the opportunity to oversee its construction."
244154 "Gathering all the resources for such a monument may prove difficult because of our troubled relations with the Canaanites, but we can still rely on the Minoans of Crete for help."
244155 "This task will be difficult, but Hatshepsut wishes you the best of luck and the blessings of the gods."

244156 "Megiddo, 1457 BCE"
244157 "Egypt is thriving under the rule of her new pharaohs, but it is time to look outward. Pharaoh Thutmose III is expanding the army and intends to use it to invade Canaan."
244158 "For centuries, that land has been within the Egyptian sphere of influence, but now it must be added to the empire once and for all. The Canaanites think they can resist Egypt and have formed an alliance, led by the kings of Kadesh and Megiddo."
244159 "They are gathering a vast army, but the gods favor us. Commander, the pharaoh entrusts you with the first attacking division. Do not disappoint the pharaoh, as he is watching your every move."

83889 "RESOURCES\nAssign villagers to chop wood, hunt, forage, fish, and mine to increase your stockpile of resources (shown in the upper-left corner of the game screen). Use these resources to expand your civilization by constructing buildings, training new units, and advancing to the next age.\n\nTo assign a Villager a task, select the Villager, and then right-click a work site on the game screen. For example, to assign a Villager to chop wood, select a Villager, and then right-click a tree. To gather food, assign Villagers to hunt animals, forage berry bushes, or fish near the shore. You can also build Fishing Boats to fish for food. Villagers gather as much as they can carry before depositing it at the Town Center (the primitive structure in the middle of the game screen when the scenario begins).\n\nCREATING NEW UNITS\nYou can create new Villagers to gather resources more quickly and train military units to attack the enemy. You must build Houses to support the new Villagers, military units, and boats you create.

The fury of your brother Menelaus, Helen’s husband and king of Sparta, knows no bounds, and he has appealed to you, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, for help."
244233 "Jumping at the opportunity for war and renown, you have assembled a vast army bent on the destruction of Troy. The city-state lies far across the Aegean Sea, however, and the campaign will require a strong navy to launch a seaborne invasion of the Trojan heartland. Go forth dauntlessly – eternal fame and glory await!"

244237 "The Mycenaean civilization has fallen to ruin, and the rule of the Aegean is up for grabs. In the midst of this chaos, your city-state of Athens has managed to survive and even prosper, expanding throughout much of Attica. The local agricultural supply is not enough to support your burgeoning population, however, and before long overpopulation is sure to lead to famine and anarchy."
244238 "The ruling council has decided on a bold plan to send settlers to establish overseas settlements in Ionia. The local Luwians have inhabited this region for centuries, but they are far too weak to repel your people. Demonstrate your dominance of the region. Seize the initiative quickly before famine strikes, or the Luwians decide to raid Attica and the rest of Greece!"

244242 "Over the past several centuries, the Greek city-states have expanded their influence both in Hellas and overseas. Now, a powerful coalition led by the dual monarchy of Sparta is challenging your city-state of Athens for dominance in a conflict that has lasted three decades. In the wake of the disastrous Sicilian Expedition, Sparta has seized the initiative, claiming several key victories and drawing ever closer to Athens."
244243 "You have no hope of defeating the battle-hardened Spartans in the field at present, but there is a chance that you may be able to defend the city long enough for reinforcements and supplies to arrive and turn the tide in your favor. The Spartan army is reliant on a large baggage train of supplies – if it is captured, their siege will be delayed considerably."

244246 "Mesopotamia, 401 BCE"
244247 "The Peloponnesian War has concluded, bringing peace to Hellas for a short time. You are part of a company of 10,000 Greek mercenaries hired to support Cyrus the Younger in his struggle to claim the Persian throne from Artaxerxes II, his brother. The Battle of Cunaxa yielded an overwhelming victory for your company, but it is all for naught as Cyrus fell in combat."
244248 "Your contingent of mercenaries is now isolated deep inside the Persian Empire, with no help in sight. The journey to the nearest port on the Black Sea will be long and perilous, but it yields the opportunity for ample spoils and an eventual return home. Capture the Artifact held in the city on the coast, build a Transport Ship there, and bring the Artifact to friendly territory in the far north."

244251 "Asia Minor, 334 BCE"
244252 "War! The rivalry between Hellas and Persia has reignited after the irruption of the Macedonians into the region, and the Greeks have been united under you, Alexander of Macedon. You have dauntlessly marched into Asia Minor and are now surrounded by your enemies."
244253 "Although they are numerous, they are disorganized, uncoordinated, and cowardly – no match for your disciplined forces. Seize the initiative and defeat them individually before they can prepare their defenses. Victory in this campaign will etch your name into the pages of history for eternity!"

84241 "Sumerians"
84242 "Akkadians"
84248 "1. The Babylonians can support a population of 50 and are restricted to the Bronze Age.\n\n2. Use your Priest to convert enemy Villagers and military units. It is important that your Priest does not die until you have at least converted one or more Villagers and can build a base.\n\n3. The town to the east may be your best bet for establishing a quick foothold, as it is the weakest of the two."
84249 "+ Defeat the Sumerians."

84279 "+ Return both Artifacts to the flagged area on your side of the river."

84303 "Hittite Army"
84308 "1. The Babylonians begin in the Iron Age and can support a population of 50.\n\n2. You are stranded on a marshy island, but your Priest may be able to 'convince' your enemies in the area to help you escape.\n\n3. The old Priest saw an uninhabited island to the north full of resources before you ran aground. This could make a good base of operations.\n\n4. The Priest tells of a Hittite engineer in the western part of the swamp who could be convinced to change sides."
84309 "When you convert an enemy transport boat that has units aboard, only the transport boat changes ownership. The soldiers on board will remain enemies, but will be trapped until you unload them."
84310 "+ Defeat the Hittite Army."
84311 "+ Find a way off the island."

84331 "Elamite Army"
84338 "1. The Babylonians begin in the Iron Age and can support a population of 75.\n\n2. The lands east of the river offer a safe haven for you to escape to.\n\n3. The Elamites will be preoccupied with looting your old city for a while. Use that time to rebuild your strength and exact revenge upon them!"

84368 "1. The long road ahead is paved with many obstacles. Sometimes it is better to race through a hotspot than to stand and fight.\n\n2. Gather as many allies as you can along your way – you will need them in the end.\n\n3. Landing an army near Susa is a daunting task. Use the shallows around the city to land Priests and Catapults in range of the city's defenses and destroy them from a distance.\n\n4. On your way, you will have the chance to obtain a few Priests. Use them to heal and bolster your force with converts before attacking Susa."

It is preferable to use it for technologies that improve your units.\n\n3. Once you have cleared a path to the Temple, you can try to rush your Artifact to it as a last resort."

Prepare your defenses quickly, for there are enemies on all sides. The Babylonians have excellent walls and towers.\n\n3. Do not attack until you are prepared to face the enemy at full strength.\n\n4. The Assyrian king has promised you help. You can find his reinforcements in the desert to the east."

Catapults are your best chance of destroying enemy walls. Use these weapons wisely to gain control of the map.\n\n3. The Medes are sending their best soldiers, siege engines, and ships to help tear down the walls of Nineveh. Your scouts report that they have arrived in the east."
84459 "+ Destroy the Wonder in Nineveh."
84460 "+ Destroy Nineveh's Wonder."


244256 "Mesopotamia, 1760 BCE"
244257 "The small city state of Babylon is growing under the energetic leadership of its new king, Hammurabi. You have been sent downriver to bring some enclaves of Sumerians and Akkadians into the fold. Use your powers of persuasion when you can, but do not hesitate to resort to war if they prove to be resistant."

244261 "Tigris Valley, 1755 BCE"
244262 "The addition of the Sumerian and Akkadian cities to the rising Babylonian Empire pleases Hammurabi greatly. Now, he sets a more difficult task for you. One of our frontier cities was recently sacked and important treasures, including a copy of Hammurabi's law code engraved in stone, were carried off to the Tigris River."
244263 "Chase the raiders to where the treasures were taken and build up a force to recover them. They must not be allowed to move the treasures upstream. The prestige of your great king remains tarnished for as long as these treasures remain in enemy hands."

244266 "Euphrates River Bank, 1595 BCE"
244267 "Disaster has struck – a Hittite army has marched down the shore of the Euphrates River and sacked Babylon! Although your party is isolated among enemies in the marshlands, this is our only hope for exacting vengeance on the raiders. A Hittite force remains in the area, trying to gather more loot. Clear your enemies from the marshlands and burn the Hittite encampment to the ground!"

244271 "Babylon, 1185 – 1155 BCE"
244272 "Following the Hittite sack of Babylon, the city has come under the dominion of the Kassites, who have controlled it for nearly 500 years. Kassite rule is in danger, however, because of Elamite and Assyrian intrusions. Another Elamite army is pressing forward at this moment and is moving to take Babylon."
244273 "If the city cannot be held, you are to save what you can, retreat downriver, and build up a new army. When you are prepared, retake the city of Babylon and destroy the invading Elamites."

244276 "Karun River near Susa, 1120 BCE"
244277 "The glory of Babylon has been restored by the reconquest of lands formerly lost to the Elamites, and by ejecting the foreign Kassite rulers from our territories. However, King Nebuchadnezzar I vows that taking back former Babylonian land is not enough. The Elamites must feel his wrath in their homeland. Nebuchadnezzar I has ordered you to attack Susa, the capital of the Elamites, just across the Karun river."
244278 "In one of their previous raids, the Elamites carted off a golden statue of the most important god of the Babylonians; Marduk. Your task is to recapture it to strengthen Nebuchadnezzar's legitimacy back home. Peoples long oppressed by the Elamites will give you aid in your quest if you can locate them."

244281 "Eastern Mesopotamia, 1119 BCE"
244282 "The raid into Elam was successful and the statue of Marduk has been recovered, but it must be returned to Babylonia. There are still bands of Elamites and other enemies roaming the Zagros Mountains who wish to prevent the return of the statue. Bring the statue safely to your frontier temple where it can be guarded prior to being moved to Babylon."

244286 "The Euphrates River, 748 – 734 BCE"
244287 "Babylonia has succumbed to the continuous invasions of the Aramaeans – yet another semi-nomadic tribe from the west. The empire has been reduced to poverty and our kings hold onto little more than their grand titles."
244288 "Things are about to change, however. An Assyrian general named Tiglath-Pileser has rebelled against his king and has taken the throne. He is willing to support our new king Nabonassar to retake land lost to the Aramaeans, our common enemy. Nabonassar commands you to revitalize the Babylonian armies and destroy the invaders encroaching on our territory."

244291 "Nineveh, 612 BCE"
244292 "Finally, Babylonia has been liberated from Assyrian oppression. Civil wars, rebellions and foreign invasions have brought the once-mighty empire to its knees. The Assyrians have fallen back behind the imposing walls of their capital at Nineveh while an army of Babylonians and Medes converge on the capital of Assyria. Destroy the Wonder in Nineveh to break the power of the Assyrians indefinitely."


RMS_ALLIANCE_RO "Alliance - An open land with rolling hills where players begin and expand together, seeking to conquer the opposing alliance in the valley on the other side."
RMS_CITADEL_RO "Citadel - Players begin within the confines of sturdy-looking stone walls, but with a vast, empty field beyond and a forest surrounding the players from behind, things may not be as safe as they seem."
RMS_CLEARING_RO "Clearing - A dense forest gives way to a vast clearing in the center, where elephants roam freely and fierce battles are fought. With no Town Center to begin with, players must explore and choose the right place to settle."
RMS_POMPEIICOASTAL_RO "Coastal - In this mixture of archipelagoes and islands, battles will occur both on land and water, but accessible shallow crossings ensure that neither strategy can dominate too much."
RMS_POMPEIICONTINENTAL_RO "Continental - A massive island with nothing but the ocean around it. Conquering the hills deep within becomes just as vital as battling on the coasts."
RMS_DARKFOREST_RO "Dark Forest - With only a single road connecting allies, this forest remains an uncharted place. Creep through its darkness, fight in narrow passages, and push your enemies into the corners of the jungle from which there is no escape."
RMS_DESERTRIDGE_RO "Desert Ridge - A barren ridge of sand and rocks stretches across a vast desert, and the only way to conquer the enemy’s strongholds is to cross it."
RMS_GOLDMOUNTAIN_RO "Gold Mountain - Players must emerge from the safety of the forests and venture towards the mountain of gold — a strategic place that is difficult to defend and even harder to conquer."
RMS_POMPEIIHIGHLAND_RO "Highland - With moderately sparse forests, hilly lands, and an abundance of wildlife, this map brings out the best of the classic battles on land."
RMS_HILLCOUNTRY_RO "Hill Country - More open and with steeper slopes, this fiercely contested land takes aggression to an even higher level."
RMS_INLAND_RO "Inland - A balanced mixture of land and water, these stretches of grassland are constantly interrupted by lakes or rivers. With shallows providing many a passage across, unpredictable outcomes are almost guaranteed."
RMS_INSIDEOUT_RO "Inside Out - Two rings of forests with players trapped in between. Flimsy walls offer only temporary protection, while attacks can come from any direction."
RMS_POMPEIILANDNOMAD_RO "Land Nomad - Villagers begin stranded in the midst of these dense forests and flat stretches of grassland, but exploration yields rewarding results as the lands are rich in berry bushes and wildlife."
RMS_LARGEISLANDS_RO "Large Islands - Cut off from all others and with no shallow crossing in sight, players will experience the best of naval warfare any day or night."
RMS_POMPEIIMEDITERRANEAN_RO "Mediterranean - A large lake at the center, with rivers flowing in from random directions. This map offers plenty of battles on both water and land."
RMS_POMPEIIMEGARANDOM_RO "MegaRandom - Ever dreamed of an endlessly unpredictable map where anything is possible and nothing is guaranteed? Multiply it by ten and you have... MegaRandom."
RMS_MUDDYWATERS_RO "Muddy Waters - The lake in the center has all but dried up. Now only shallow bogland remains where deep water fish once swam."
RMS_NARROWS_RO "Narrows - An intersection of islands with plenty of shallows to provide passage from one to the next."
RMS_POMPEIINOMAD_RO "Nomad - Stranded on a hilly island with no Town Center, players must be quick to settle and expand as they compete for resources and limited space."
RMS_POMPEIIOASIS_RO "Oasis - A barren desert gives way to a small palm forest surrounding a lake — but with no fish within and no way to build a dock, the forest remains the focal point of the ensuing battles."
RMS_OCEANCHANNEL_RO "Ocean Channel - Two islands lie opposite each other, close enough to see the opposite shore, but too far to cross on foot. Travel across and conquer enemy territory while managing to defend your own."
RMS_OCEANRING_RO "Ocean Ring - Springing off of the little islets around, players expand and compete over a ring of land abundant in all resources."
RMS_PLATEAUS_RO "Plateaus - Open lands, steep slopes, and thirsty elephants seeking the last drops of water await in this uphill conquest of desert plateaus."
RMS_RIVERCROSSING_RO "River Crossing - A dried-up river once ran through this desert land, but now only lone patches of fresh water remain for the animals to drink. There is little cover to find, but still plenty of wildlife to hunt."
RMS_POMPEIIRIVERS_RO "Rivers - Winding rivers split and carve through densely-forested lands, forming pockets of deep water as well as shallows and sand."
RMS_SAHARA_RO "Sahara - A vast, barren desert, where only the lowlands offer any shelter or resources. With forests dwindling rapidly, many fierce battles will occur on the slopes of Sahara’s numerous valleys."
RMS_SMALLISLANDS_RO "Small Islands - Stranded on separate isles, with few resources and little space, players must be quick to conquer their neighbors in this island-hopping race."
RMS_TWINSETTLEMENTS_RO "Twin Settlements - Each player begins with two Town Centers. The battle for this open land will begin sooner than expected, and carefully-planned strategies will turn into pure chaos."
